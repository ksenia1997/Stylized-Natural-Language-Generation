Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .

This is an interesting movie ! ''

It 's not only dull because we 've seen -LRB- Eddie -RRB- Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .

An extremely unpleasant film .

A movie just for Friday fans , critics be damned .

If you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again .

Despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , The Man Who Wrote Rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .

The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .

Everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .

I like it .

They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .

It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .

Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .

A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .

Has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together .

Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .

Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .

Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .

Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime .

All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling .

The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...

This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .

A bit too eager to please .

Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .

The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .

It 's just not very smart .

Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .

Hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script .

A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .

Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls .

4Ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly .

Trailer park Magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all .

Sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story .

The film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch Christian Right propaganda machine into national media circles .

Dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring .

Cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy .

To be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for God 's sake !

As we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- Jason is a killer who does n't know the meaning of the word ` quit . '

The filmmakers might want to look it up .

A frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .

What 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .

An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .

Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , Vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .

Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .

It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .

Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .

A pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between XXX and Vertical Limit .

Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .

The film has a childlike quality about it .

The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers .

Has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children 's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .

Mendes still does n't quite know how to fill a frame .

An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .

A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .

Pure of intention and passably diverting , His Secret Life is light , innocuous and unremarkable .

Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .

Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression .

All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .

Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .

There 's no question that Epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .

Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''

Ignoring that , he made Swimfan anyway

By that measure , it is a failure .

Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .

You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .

Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .

Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .

The film is flat .

The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .

It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .

The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .

Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable

Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work .

Not once does it come close to being exciting .

A Frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , Bartleby performs neither one very well .

It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .

The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .

Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .

So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .

Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .

Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .

There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .

Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .

A moving picture that does not move .

Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !

A cartoon ?

Did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 Armenia ?

Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .

The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .

The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .

Average , at best , I 'm afraid .

Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .

The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . ''

Worthy of the gong .

It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .

Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .

Traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichÃ©s that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill .

There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .

The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .

Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .

A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .

Both the crime story and the love story are unusual .

By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .

Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !

Wes Craven 's presence is felt ; not the Craven of ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' or ` The Hills Have Eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` Deadly Friend . '

... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .

Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...

It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .

Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .

An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .

Horrible .

The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .

Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB- excepting Love Hewitt -RRB- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .

An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .

It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .

The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .

Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez .

It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard -LRB- Eileen Walsh -RRB- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .

... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''

ending .

It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .

So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .

It 's Splash without the jokes .

Shallow , noisy and pretentious .

Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .

Granddad of Le Nouvelle Vague , Jean-Luc Godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek .

It 's better than The Phantom Menace .

Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .

Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .

A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .

Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .

Ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and Joan 's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he 's a disloyal satyr .

It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .

Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .

Its generic villains lack any intrigue -LRB- other than their funny accents -RRB- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .

Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .

Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .

With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .

While Glover , the irrepressible eccentric of River 's Edge , Dead Man and Back to the Future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents Bartleby 's main overall flaw .

Otherwise , this could be a passable date film .

This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .

The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .

This dubious product of a college-spawned -LRB- Colgate U. -RRB- comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .

The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .

Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers\/Abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers .

... will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks .

After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .

As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .

Life or Something Like It has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities .

One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .

But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .

... generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish .

It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .

This one is a few bits funnier than Malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks .

Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .

... one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else .

The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .

A clichÃ©d and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men .

A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .

Includes too much obvious padding .

Do n't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle .

The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .

The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .

Occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring .

A movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end .

Who are ` they ' ?

They exist for hushed lines like `` They 're back ! ''

Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .

Were Dylan Thomas alive to witness first-time director Ethan Hawke 's strained Chelsea Walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Theatre . '

The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .

I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , I do n't see the point .

It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .

Murder by Numbers just does n't add up .

Clare Peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little American Pie-like irreverence .

Video games are more involving than this mess .

Clayburgh and Tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves Eric Schaeffer .

A pale Xerox of other , better crime movies .

... a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional .

Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .

A perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .

The adventure does n't contain half the excitement of Balto , or quarter the fun of Toy Story 2 .

Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .

Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh 's best films , `` Erin Brockovich , '' `` Out of Sight '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven , '' never were .

Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .

In the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director Roger Kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags .

You can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer .

Thumbs down .

Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ?

The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .

Barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material .

Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority .

It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .

The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .

Nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .

A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .

It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .

Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me -LRB- horrors ! -RRB-

There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .

Where 's the movie here ?

A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .

Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .

Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .

Although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .

It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .

Nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .

I am sorry that I was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy .

No telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie .

His comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level .

Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire .

They should have called it Gutterball .

Thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters .

It 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic .

Taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes .

It believes it 's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it 's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile .

Villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in Bibi 's generic angst -LRB- there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows -RRB- .

I got a headache watching this meaningless downer .

Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .

The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .

Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .

The plot combines The Blues Brothers and Almost Famous -LRB- but with bears , and a G rating -RRB- , with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .

No way I can believe this load of junk .

It 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .

But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?

Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , Kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .

It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .

This movie is maddening .

It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .

... is an arthritic attempt at directing by Callie Khouri .

It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .

A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .

This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .

Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .

A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .

We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !

when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .

Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .

So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .

The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .

The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .

Over age 15 ?

In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .

Chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .

Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .

Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .

If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .

Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .

They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .

Barely gets off the ground .

Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .

From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .

Do not see this film .

Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .

If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .

Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .

It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .

A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .

What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .

Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .

Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .

Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface .

That 's a cheat .

Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .

This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .

An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director John McKay can swallow .

It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .

It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .

A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .

It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''

columns from Ladies Home Journal ...

Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .

An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .

There can be no other explanation .

Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .

-LRB- director -RRB- O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .

Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .

Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .

Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .

Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .

If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .

I do n't think I laughed out loud once .

And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .

... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .

The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .

His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .

Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .

A workshop mentality prevails .

Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .

-LRB- W -RRB- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .

Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .

The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .

As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .

This is her Blue Lagoon .

Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .

The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -LRB- featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer -RRB- brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .

... the movie is just a plain old monster .

Fancy a real downer ?

Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .

Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .

Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .

Of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .

Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .

Exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .

The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .

I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .

Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami .

This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .

As vulgar as it is banal .

You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .

The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .

A wildly inconsistent emotional experience .

Sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .

There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .

... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .

Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .

just not campy enough

Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .

The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .

For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .

And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .

So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises

Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .

The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .

Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .

Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .

Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .

Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .

Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .

I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers .

The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .

A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of -LRB- Besson 's -RRB- earlier work .

This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .

It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .

But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?

Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .

The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .

A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .

The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .

As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .

With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .

Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .

The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .

One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .

Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .

The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .

With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .

Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .

Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort

Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .

Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .

It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .

The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .

Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .

The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .

It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .

Bad .

Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .

Long Time Dead ?

Not nearly long enough .

Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .

A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .

Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .

It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .

I 'm just too bored to care .

Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .

As befits its title , this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear .

Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .

It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .

Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .

Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .

A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .

Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?

This is so bad .

Even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .

The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .

The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .

Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '

Or emptying rat traps .

Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .

The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .

it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so

It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .

Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .

Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .

The story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -LRB- and torturing -RRB- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .

So I just did .

Shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .

The lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .

For anyone who grew up on Disney 's 1950 Treasure Island , or remembers the 1934 Victor Fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .

Watching Scarlet Diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both .

Instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .

Meandering , sub-aquatic mess : It 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .

The ending is a cop-out .

What happens to John Q ?

Has the feel of an unedited personal journal .

Remember when Bond had more glamour than clamor ?

This charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make Jay and Silent Bob 's Excellent Adventure seem understated .

You can practically smell the patchouli oil .

To say Analyze That is De Niro 's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .

The actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .

An often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach

This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .

There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .

The editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .

Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : Young is cool , and too young is too cool .

Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately Serving Sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .

Soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .

The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors

The production values are up there .

Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it 's all over his Chelsea Walls .

While the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .

If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .

A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .

Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .

Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .

To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .

He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .

A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .

The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .

Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .

A battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .

The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .

... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .

Nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichÃ©s and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .

It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .

Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .

The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .

I hated every minute of it .

Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !

The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .

Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .

But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .

Egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .

It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .

The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .

I 've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .

De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .

Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .

That is essentially what 's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .

A compendium of Solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .

Little more than a frothy vanity project .

IHOPs do n't pile on this much syrup .

A gimmick in search of a movie : how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .

... the last time I saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs .

... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .

... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .

It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .

It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .

Largely a for-fans artifact .

Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .

There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .

-LRB- I -RRB- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing .

First-time director JoÃ£o Pedro Rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .

A strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .

-LRB- Director -RRB- Byler may yet have a great movie in him , but Charlotte Sometimes is only half of one .

That 's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan 's existence .

The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .

It tells more than it shows .

Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .

Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .

Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .

Godawful boring slug of a movie .

Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .

Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .

... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .

Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .

For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .

Although based on a real-life person , John , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .

Yes , you are , Ben Kingsley .

Divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .

If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .

Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .

The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .

Scotland , PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .

It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .

The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .

It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .

I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .

A boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash .

Writhing under dialogue like ` You 're from two different worlds ' and ` Tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .

... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .

Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco 's last album ?

All Ms. Jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .

Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .

Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .

This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .

So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .

Enduring love but exhausting cinema .

A very bad sign .

Almost everything else is wan .

Undercover Brother does n't go far enough .

It 's just a silly black genre spoof .

The film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .

Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .

You 've already seen Heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard .

Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .

Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .

A journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which Hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking .

The movie bounces all over the map .

But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .

It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .

Not always too whimsical for its own good -LRB- but enough to do harm -RRB- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .

`` Juwanna Mann ? ''

No thanks .

Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .

There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .

Extremely confusing .

For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .

What happened with Pluto Nash ?

How did it ever get made ?

How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?

Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .

With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .

The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .

It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .

It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .

This film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .

Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .

As -LRB- the characters -RRB- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .

The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .

Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .

This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .

-LRB- Plays -RRB- in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .

The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .

Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .

A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .

Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .

Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .

... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .

A bravura exercise in emptiness .

This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .

A real clunker .

A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .

A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .

Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .

... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .

A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .

As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .

Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .

The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .

If you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .

What kids will discover is a new collectible .

Beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... -LRB- but -RRB- the script goes wrong at several key junctures .

There 's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .

When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .

But as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .

If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .

The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .

Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .

The director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -LRB- most notably wretched sound design -RRB- .

About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .

Too simple for its own good .

Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .

A chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .

The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .

All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .

A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .

Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .

Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .

The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .

The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .

The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .

This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .

I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .

The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .

At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .

Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .

The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .

Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .

Lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun .

Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves

If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -LRB- literally -RRB- .

So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .

Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .

There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .

Haneke keeps us at arm 's length .

All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .

Now it 's just tired .

Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .

Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .

With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .

So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .

Or a profit .

But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .

Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .

Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .

... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .

Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .

Truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .

Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .

Feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .

Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .

After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .

If I Spy were funny -LRB- enough -RRB- or exciting -LRB- enough -RRB- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .

Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .

Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .

Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .

A very average science fiction film .

The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .

The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .

A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .

Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .

Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .

None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .

But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick -LRB- remember Cabin Boy ? -RRB-

At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .

The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .

Most of the action setups are incoherent .

The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .

Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .

The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture

I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .

Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .

Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .

Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .

I loved looking at this movie .

Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .

It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .

fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .

A gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .

A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .

It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .

The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .

The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .

It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .

Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .

Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .

To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .

This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .

Ecks this one off your must-see list .

Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .

It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .

All in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .

Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .

The film 's center will not hold .

Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .

Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .

As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .

A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .

You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .

George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .

... too dull to enjoy .

A morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-TV look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off The Sixth Sense .

Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .

A sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .

Admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch .

But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .

The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .

Barely goes beyond comic book status .

Maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .

It 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .

A movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a Bolly-Holly masala mess .

Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .

Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .

Unfortunately , as a writer , Mr. Montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .

The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .

... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .

Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .

The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .

Warmed-over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard .

-LRB- Sen 's -RRB- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .

There are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .

There 's not enough to sustain the comedy .

Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .

We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans conflict .

Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .

I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .

I kept wishing I was watching a documentary about the wartime Navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious Hollywood hoo-ha .

No number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .

The movie makes absolutely no sense .

Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?

Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .

The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .

The Gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .

Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .

A TV episode inflated past its natural length .

Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .

There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .

The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .

The story ... is moldy and obvious .

It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .

Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .

Punish the vehicle to adore the star .

Even if Britney Spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .

Big Fat Liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .

A mild , reluctant , thumbs down .

Pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .

An uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .

Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .

` Abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let Dante 's gloomy words be your guide .

What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .

Birot 's directorial debut -LRB- she co-wrote the script with Christophe HonorÃ© -RRB- is n't so much bad as it is bland .

Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .

If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .

A frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience .

Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .

While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .

... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .

The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman -LRB- who never gets to play that flute -RRB- has all the charm of a meltdown .

The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .

It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .

Fails to bring as much to the table .

A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick .

Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .

If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .

I hate this movie

It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .

Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .

... pitiful , slapdash disaster .

There are plenty of scenes in Frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .

Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .

A selection of scenes in search of a movie .

-LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .

Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .

As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .

While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .

A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .

It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death

I think it was Plato who said , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '

Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .

I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .

This is more a case of ` Sacre bleu ! '

than ` Magnifique ' .

is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .

Not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance .

It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '

Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''

The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .

Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .

The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .

Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .

The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .

This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater

Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .

When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .

It never rises to its clever what-if concept .

Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .

The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .

I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .

Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .

The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .

A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .

Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .

An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .

There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .

A wordy wisp of a comedy .

Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .

It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .

SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .

After all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .

There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door .

One big blustery movie where nothing really happens .

A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .

Even if it is generally amusing from time to time , I Spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .

A worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school TV special .

Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '

Make like the title and dodge this one .

It 's obvious -LRB- Je-Gyu is -RRB- trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom .

Despite its raucous intent , XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad and as rebellious as spring break .

Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .

Would Benigni 's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?

It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy .

Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .

Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend .

It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .

That is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion .

Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .

A puzzle whose pieces do not fit .

Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .

An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .

Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .

No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .

They should have found Orson Welles ' great-grandson .

Thriller directorial debut for Traffic scribe Gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces do n't quite fit together .

There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .

Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .

Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .

The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .

This is not a Jackie Chan movie .

It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .

What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?

Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .

Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .

Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .

Like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again .

The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .

The animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet Return to Neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief .

It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .

It 's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in Invincible and overlook its drawbacks .

Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .

The most remarkable -LRB- and frustrating -RRB- thing about World Traveler , which opens today in Manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank .

An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .

One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .

Make no mistake , ivans xtc .

The concept is a hoot .

It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .

A hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .

But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .

The most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog Rover Dangerfield .

Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .

While we want MacDowell 's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her .

A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .

Tom Shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing Adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it .

Unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .

Your taste for Jonah - A Veggie Tales Movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the Holy Spirit .

A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .

How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?

Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .

This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .

The whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for Disney sequels .

With Rare Birds , as with The Shipping News before it , an attempt is made to transplant a Hollywood star into Newfoundland 's wild soil -- and The Rock once again resists the intrusion .

Are monsters born , or made ?

The narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures Esther , but she 's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and Esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard .

Less about Shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw Quentin Tarantino 's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .

The film is like sitting in a downtown cafÃ© , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .

This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .

A shame that Stealing Harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .

Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .

Collapses under its own meager weight .

This is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous .

If you adored The Full Monty so resoundingly that you 're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained .

Technically and artistically inept .

A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .

Call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but I believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid .

Death might be a release .

`` -LRB- Hopkins -RRB- does n't so much phone in his performance as fax it .

No , even that 's too committed .

He gets his secretary to fax it . ''

Sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .

Priggish , lethargically paced parable of renewal .

The filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story .

Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co-writer Ed Decter .

The characters are interesting and the relationship between Yosuke and Saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there 's not enough to the story to fill two hours .

Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone .

You leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends .

It 's depressing to see how far Herzog has fallen .

The question hanging over The Time Machine is not , as the main character suggests , ` what if ? '

`` Freaky Friday , '' it 's not .

Maybe you 'll be lucky , and there 'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back .

The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of Scooter .

This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers .

Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .

Really dumb but occasionally really funny .

It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .

It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .

Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .

-LRB- T -RRB- he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .

Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .

Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs ...

It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .

Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .

Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .

Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .

A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .

A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .

If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .

This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '

At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .

An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .

The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .

the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale

If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .

If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .

With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .

Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot .

Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . '

You 'll cry for your money back .

So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .

Ken Russell would love this .

In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .

Bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies .

Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .

The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .

What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !

Opera on film is never satisfactory .

Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .

It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill

The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .

as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .

A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .

What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song .

Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .

It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .

This romantic\/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .

If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .

Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .

An uninspired preachy and clichÃ©d war film .

If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .

It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding mÃ©tier .

It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .

The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .

Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .

The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .

Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .

-LRB- Seems -RRB- even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .

The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not .

It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .

Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .

Has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .

Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .

The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .

Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .

Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .

... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .

In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -LRB- but none of the sheer lust -RRB- .

Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .

Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .

It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .

So here it is : It 's about a family of sour immortals .

The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .

Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .

Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .

Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .

A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .

It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .

By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .

It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .

made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .

But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .

With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .

Does n't really add up to much .

This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie .

It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .

The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''

tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen George Roy Hill 's 1973 film , `` The Sting . ''

Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .

A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .

Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .

Almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai 's villainous father to the endless action sequences .

Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .

It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .

It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .

Go for La Salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .

It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .

Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .

But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .

Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .

It recycles every clichÃ© about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .

I 'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it does n't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks .

Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .

Feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum .

No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .

The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '

Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me .

It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .

It 's just merely very bad .

Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .

The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .

Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .

Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .

If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .

Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .

Rodriguez ... was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight .

A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .

Only masochistic moviegoers need apply .

Not bad , but not all that good .

Bacon keeps things interesting , but do n't go out of your way to pay full price .

What 's next ?

Rob Schneider , Dana Carvey and Sarah Michelle Gellar in The Philadelphia Story ?

David Spade as Citizen Kane ?

Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center .

The problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .

Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .

Summer 's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this .

A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .

The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .

... familiar and predictable , and 4\/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than -LRB- writer-director -RRB- Franc .

A little objectivity could have gone a long way .

I believe Silberling had the best intentions here , but he just does n't have the restraint to fully realize them .

McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .

High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .

The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .

Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .

The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .

I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .

Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .

Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .

-LRB- The film 's -RRB- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .

Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .

If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .

Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .

It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .

Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .

The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .

Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .

Every joke is repeated at least four times .

Comes across as a fairly weak retooling .

The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .

Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .

-LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .

An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .

Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .

Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .

More a gunfest than a Rock concert .

A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .

Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .

For free .

I still want my money back .

... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .

Strictly middle of the road .

Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .

After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichÃ©s , depression and bad alternative music .

No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .

Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .

In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .

Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pÃ¨re-fils confrontations .

McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .

Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .

New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...

Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .

Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .

Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .

For a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , What to Do in Case of Fire ?

Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .

An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .

For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .

-LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .

There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .

The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .

This is just lazy writing .

It 's a gag that 's worn a bit thin over the years , though Do n't Ask still finds a few chuckles .

Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .

Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .

Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .

I have no problem with `` difficult '' movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out .

But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort

Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .

Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .

Barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .

The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .

A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .

With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .

What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel .

It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .

As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .

The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .

Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .

If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .

This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .

Feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class .

Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .

Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy\/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .

Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .

Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations

The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .

Yo , it 's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo .

I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .

This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .

Hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .

Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears .

It did n't go straight to video .

Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .

The great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash , and send it to its proper home .

About as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life .

An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .

We could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product .

Becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .

Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .

Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .

The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .

So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie .

This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .

Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .

The script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of ` hypertime ' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for Spy Kids .

Starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker Yvan Attal quickly writes himself into a corner .

Some Like It Hot on the Hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny .

Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .

Visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying .

Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience .

Dismally dull sci-fi comedy .

There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .

When one hears Harry Shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best

... this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ...

Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .

A singularly off-putting romantic comedy .

It all comes down to whether you can tolerate Leon Barlow .

A movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting than by its own story .

As self-aware movies go , Who is Cletis Tout ?

There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .

Its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .

At times , it actually hurts to watch .

Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .

-LRB- Tries -RRB- to parody a genre that 's already a joke in the United States .

I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .

There is nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a - thousand-times - before movie .

A lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles French , Japanese and Hollywood cultures .

Such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution .

So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .

A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita .

Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .

It 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There 's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .

The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .

Sorority Boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .

Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming .

Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .

This is the first film I 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .

Fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .

Get out your pooper-scoopers .

Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .

Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .

While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .

It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .

Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .

It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .

A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .

All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .

Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .

There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .

A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .

Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .

A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .

Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clichÃ© of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .

A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .

Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .

A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .

Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .

But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .

Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .

It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .

Parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil

What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .

The movie is without intent .

You expect more from director Michael Apted -LRB- Enigma -RRB- and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup .

The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?

The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .

I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again .

It 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from .

The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .

Unfortunately , neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .

A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .

This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio .

Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !

In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24\/7 .

Ah , the travails of metropolitan life !

Alas , another breathless movie about same !

No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .

`` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? ''

Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .

The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .

It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .

A great script brought down by lousy direction .

Big mistake .

A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .

Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` Miami Vice '' checklist of power boats , Latin music and dog tracks .

In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .

The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .

An encouraging effort from McCrudden

The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .

If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .

To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...

This u-boat does n't have a captain .

With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .

I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .

It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .

The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .

even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .

Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter .

Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .

The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?

Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .

directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name

The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .

While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere .

Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .

Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .

The film is all over the place , really .

The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .

While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter

It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .

And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .

The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .

It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .

Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .

... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .

Wait to see it then .

This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .

Over and over again .

The threat implied in the title PokÃ©mon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .

Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .

Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .

It 's not an easy one to review .

Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .

But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .

Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .

Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .

Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .

Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .

You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell .

Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?

A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .

More trifle than triumph .

Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .

It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .

Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .

... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .

-LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .

No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .

This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .

Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .

Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?

When the twist endings were actually surprising ?

Where the film falters is in its tone .

The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .

It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .

Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .

This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .

Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?

` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .

It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .

The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .

Competently directed but terminally cute drama .

The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .

A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .

The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .

Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .

No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .

The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?

The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .

... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .

A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .

The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .

More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine

But it does n't need Gangs of New York .

Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .

We do n't even like their characters .

Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .

The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .

It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .

This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head

Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .

It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .

A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .

Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''

an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? ''

- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .

The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .

A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .

Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .

A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .

Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying .

Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .

The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .

Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .

The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .

In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .

The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .

You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .

Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .

If you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in Anne Geddes , John Grisham , and Thomas Kincaid .

We get the comedy we settle for .

The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .

Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .

is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .

Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .

The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .

Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .

... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .

In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .

Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .

his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .

It 's a masterpiece .

By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .

Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .

` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '

The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .

As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .

Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '

The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...

I survived .

The worst film of the year .

Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .

A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .

The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .

No surprises .
