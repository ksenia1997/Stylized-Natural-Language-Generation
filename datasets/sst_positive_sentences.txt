`` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker .

Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .

Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit

They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .

Directors John Musker and Ron Clements , the team behind The Little Mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they are n't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .

The direction , by George Hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .

Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .

It has plenty of laughs .

An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .

Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .

One of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .

It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .

The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .

The video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .

An achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .

It 's Tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too .

Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .

If you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign .

It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .

The acting is n't much better .

Watching Austin Powers in Goldmember is like binging on cotton candy .

Diane Lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue Adrian Lyne 's Unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .

This remake of Lina Wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero .

Silly , loud and goofy .

Just because A Walk to Remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls .

The boys ' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on Guei , wears down the story 's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements .

Only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate .

As pure over-the-top trash , any John Waters movie has it beat by a country mile .

Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .

Wait for it to hit cable .

My only wish is that Celebi could take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it .

It 's sort of a 21st century morality play with a Latino hip hop beat .

Paxton 's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre .

See Clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes .

But be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still .

Suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry British filmmakers have strip-mined the Monty formula mercilessly since 1997 .

There are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made A Walk to Remember a niche hit .

Yes , I have given this movie a rating of zero .

Consider it ` perfection . '

Peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .

Only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of Elizabeth Berkley 's flopping dolphin-gasm .

Kids who are into this Thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven .

Mr. Soderbergh 's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious .

Do you say `` hi '' to your lover when you wake up in the morning ?

A wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching .

If you think it 's a riot to see Rob Schneider in a young woman 's clothes , then you 'll enjoy The Hot Chick .

The sheer dumbness of the plot -LRB- other than its one good idea -RRB- and the movie 's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down .

Strangely comes off as a kingdom more mild than wild .

The next big thing 's not-so-big -LRB- and not-so-hot -RRB- directorial debut .

Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ?

Let 's hope not .

This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .

None of this is very original , and it is n't particularly funny .

A passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .

The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .

Clever but not especially compelling .

McKay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .

A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .

Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .

Falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie 's reality and stifling its creator 's comic voice .

No big hairy deal .

` This movie sucks . '

Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .

Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .

I 've had more interesting -- and , dare I say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .

The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .

A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside Danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the Bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative .

Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .

The only thing that distinguishes a Randall Wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a Randall Wallace film .

There is so much plodding sensitivity .

The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .

... too sappy for its own good .

Circuit queens wo n't learn a thing , they 'll be too busy cursing the film 's strategically placed white sheets .

As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .

Every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy .

Adults , other than the parents ... will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild .

Brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every clichÃ©d white-trash situation imaginable .

Typical animÃ© , with cheapo animation -LRB- like Saturday morning TV in the '60s -RRB- , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .

Unfortunately , Carvey 's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg .

Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .

There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .

You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .

The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .

Weirdly , Broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .

A showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor Michel Serrault , the film is less successful on other levels .

Blue Crush is so prolonged and boring it is n't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be .

The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .

While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's Animal House .

The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .

The bland outweighs the nifty , and Cletis Tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is .

It 's such a mechanical endeavor -LRB- that -RRB- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .

A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .

What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence .

No , I hate it .

This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .

A fifty car pileup of cliches .

It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .

Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .

What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .

As an actor 's showcase , Hart 's War has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player .

Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .

While kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .

It still feels like a prison stretch .

Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .

And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .

As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .

A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .

This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .

It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades .

There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .

As happily glib and vicious as its characters .

I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .

Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .

Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .

The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .

I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .

There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .

The Emperor 's Club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but ...

Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .

The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .

He 's a better actor than a standup comedian .

I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !

Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .

Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .

As plain and pedestrian as catsup --

I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but I ca n't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary .

Your stomach for Heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn .

A picture as erratic as its central character .

Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .

It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars

The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .

Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets .

Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .

Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .

Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at Blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees .

Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .

It 's drab .

It 's uninteresting .

It squanders Chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt !

The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .

This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .

It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .

I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .

The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .

An unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years .

Only for young children , if them .

Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .

For all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .

No matter how firmly director John Stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make .

The action is reasonably well-done ... yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together .

Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` Unfaithful . ''

An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus .

If only there were one for this kind of movie .

By the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest can not be revived .

Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .

I ca n't remember the last time I saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in Extreme Ops .

Too much of Nemesis has a tired , talky feel .

I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .

The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .

Viewers of Barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .

Although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , Tuck Everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action .

When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should come a-knocking , no ?

Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .

More of a career curio than a major work .

I had more fun with Ben Stiller 's Zoolander , which I thought was rather clever .

Love Liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit .

... tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry .

My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...

It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .

It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .

A boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-Century crime as a metaphor for -- well , I 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .

The film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of America 's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .

Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .

Big time .

There 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but Brooms is n't it .

As crimes go , writer-director Michael Kalesniko 's How to Kill Your Neighbor 's Dog is slight but unendurable .

An uplifting , largely bogus story .

My own minority report is that it stinks .

Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .

The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .

Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .

... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .

Being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .

A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .

waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot Oscar season currently underway .

Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .

Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .

I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .

Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .

It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .

A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .

Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .

Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .

One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .

It 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling .

Charming , if overly complicated ...

Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .

... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .

Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .

Not the Great American Comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too .

A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .

Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .

The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .

Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice .

It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .

A slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise .

Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness .

But what is missing from it all is a moral .

What is the filmmakers ' point ?

Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?

You see Robin Williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm .

You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .

Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject .

Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .

Offers absolutely nothing I had n't already seen .

You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible .

The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .

Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss .

This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .

When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .

Simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .

This toothless Dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .

Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .

Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .

Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .

A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '

What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .

An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .

There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .

And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser .

It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .

Some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .

It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .

A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .

For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 2 is still a no brainer .

Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .

Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .

This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .

The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .

A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .

A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .

We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .

Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .

Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .

A fascinating but choppy documentary .

Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .

The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .

And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .

Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .

Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .

... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .

The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .

Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .

But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .

Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .

The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .

... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .

Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?

It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .

This action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .

MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .

That 's because relatively nothing happens .

Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .

I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .

` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . '

A drama ?

And that is where Ararat went astray .

A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .

Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .

That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .

It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .

A chiller resolutely without chills .

For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .

The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .

`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .

Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .

The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .

A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .

Sunshine State surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology .

But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .

Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .

Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .

The movie is a desperate miscalculation .

It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .

We just do n't really care too much about this love story .

` Men in Black II creates a new threat for the MIB , but recycles the same premise .

But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .

A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .

A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .

It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .

Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .

Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .

Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .

Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .

Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .

What 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor .

The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard -LRB- which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog -RRB- is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .

I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .

But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .

Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .

A Blair Witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .

Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance

The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .

An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .

The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .

It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .

It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .

In the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is .

For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .

He fails .

A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .

Goes on and on to the point of nausea .

By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .

Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .

... a bland , pretentious mess .

A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .

Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .

But , for that , why not watch a documentary ?

With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .

Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break .

Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .

It 's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .

The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .

One-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation .

The corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption .

This is a truly , truly bad movie .

Despite bearing the Paramount imprint , it 's a bargain-basement European pickup .

Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there

Believability was n't one of the film 's virtues .

The Santa Clause 2 's plot may sound like it was co-written by Mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry .

Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .

Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother Hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense .

On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .

So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .

Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .

While it is welcome to see a Chinese film depict a homosexual relationship in a mature and frank fashion , Lan Yu never catches dramatic fire .

Cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility .

Worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades .

The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !

Well , they 're ` they ' .

They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .

The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .

... del Toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy .

The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .

The real question this movie poses is not ` Who ? '

but ` Why ? '

A movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment . '

Occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story .

If we 're to slap protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she 's French , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ?

Moretti plays Giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy .

Too predictably , in fact .

More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .

Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .

If Oscar had a category called Best Bad Film You Thought Was Going To Be Really Awful But Was n't , Guys would probably be duking it out with The Queen of the Damned for the honor .

A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .

Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso .

into Scrooge .

Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .

Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !

is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .

May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .

-LRB- E -RRB- ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism .

Indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie .

It 's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it 's about as exciting as a sunburn .

Mom and Dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .

The best that can be said about the work here of Scottish director Ritchie ... is that he obviously does n't have his heart in it .

Less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins .

Slick piece of cross-promotion .

It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .

And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea .

There 's just no currency in deriding James Bond for being a clichÃ©d , doddering , misogynistic boy 's club .

When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .

Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny

Should have been someone else -

The lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it .

Even in this less-than-magic kingdom , Reese rules .

Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .

Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .

Hey Arnold !

The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .

Zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .

It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .

Almost gags on its own gore .

Under 15 ?

Big Fat Waste of Time .

A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .

Oh come on .

It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .

This is nothing but familiar territory .

The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .

It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .

Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -LRB- even , at times , preposterous -RRB- turns , Love is just too , too precious in the end .

Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .

It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB- .

While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .

For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .

To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .

What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .

In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .

It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .

The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .

What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''

All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .

A sequel that 's much too big for its britches .

So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .

A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .

For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .

A coarse and stupid gross-out .

a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .

Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .

There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .

It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .

The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .

`` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .

The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .

I 'm sure if you 're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I did n't care for it .

It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .

Socrates motions for hemlock .

The script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman -LRB- the actor -RRB- can make it work .

It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .

Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .

Its well of thorn and vinegar -LRB- and simple humanity -RRB- has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .

Hilariously inept and ridiculous .

A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .

For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .

It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .

The intent is almost exactly the same -LRB- as The Full Monty -RRB- .

Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .

There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .

It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .

More maudlin than sharp .

This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento -LRB- a producer here -RRB- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .

It 's slow -- very , very slow .

It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .

My reaction in a word : disappointment .

Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .

Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .

I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .

The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .

It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .

Yes , dull .

Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .

This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .

An occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .

A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...

It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .

As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .

New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .

If any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ...

Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .

While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .

This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .

The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .

An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .

Has all the depth of a wading pool .

One long string of cliches .

-LRB- Leigh -RRB- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .

I still ca n't relate to Stuart : He 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .

-LRB- Serry -RRB- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .

Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?

A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year .

... think of it as American Pie On Valium .

Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .

Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .

With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .

For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .

It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .

Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .

Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .

What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .

The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .

A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .

There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .

... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause .

Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .

A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .

Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal

... routine , harmless diversion and little else .

Let 's hope -- shall we ?

-- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .

Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?

I do n't think so .

If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .

In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .

Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .

It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .

Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .

Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .

Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .

To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .

At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .

The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .

Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .

Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .

I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .

On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .

Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .

Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .

The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .

The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .

The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .

There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .

The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .

Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .

An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .

Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .

Who needs love like this ?

Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .

Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .

Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .

It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .

A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .

Not a stereotype is omitted nor a clichÃ© left unsaid .

At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .

A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .

The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .

Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .

\/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !

Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?

There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .

However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .

But it could have been worse .

Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .

Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .

comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .

The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear .

Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .

... Hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .

Unlike his directorial efforts , La Femme Nikita and The Professional , The Transporter lacks Besson 's perspective as a storyteller .

The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .

This one 's weaker than most .

Audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the Castro regime in less than saintly tones .

The film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .

When -LRB- De Palma 's -RRB- bad , he 's really bad , and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done .

I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then .

Uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity Short Cuts by way of Very Bad Things .

All 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags .

The only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .

If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck , wait till you see Maid in Manhattan .

... -LRB- like -RRB- channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .

A movie that , rather than skip along the Seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .

A cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .

There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .

The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .

Alex Nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget NC-17 version of Tank Girl .

The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .

The movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .

-LRB- It 's -RRB- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy Vinnie Jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .

Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it

Obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .

Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .

It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .

Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship .

Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .

With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams writer\/director\/producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .

There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .

A hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future Rice adaptations .

Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .

This is n't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it 's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .

Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .

Let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .

It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .

Extremely boring .

We never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .

One minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .

We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .

Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier 's Story . ''

It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .

All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .

Demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .

All that -LRB- Powerpuff Girls -RRB- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .

Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .

All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .

Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .

First good , then bothersome .

Excellent acting and direction .

This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring

So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .

Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .

Too bad the former Murphy Brown does n't pop Reese back .

At the bottom rung of the series ' entries .

Despite its title , Amy 's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .

Wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .

Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .

Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .

If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .

Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .

Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .

Reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .

An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .

Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .

Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy 's intrepid hero ?

No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .

While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .

Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .

This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .

Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?

Alas , it 's neither .

Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .

Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .

High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .

The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .

Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .

Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .

If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .

Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .

Moot point .

Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .

The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .

Madonna still ca n't act a lick .

If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .

But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .

Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .

Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .

Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .

A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .

Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .

The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .

Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .

Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .

We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .

It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .

The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .

It 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .

I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .

Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .

This one does .

The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .

A soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .

Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .

Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .

A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -LRB- Woody Allen -RRB- has made in the last twenty years .

It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .

This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .

Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .

There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .

Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .

The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .

A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .

Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .

would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .

For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .

Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice 's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .

There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .

When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .

The film is really not so much bad as bland .

The central story lacks punch .

Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .

No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .

The New Guy is one of them .

This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .

Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .

The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .

The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .

Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .

Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .

It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .

However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .

Extreme Oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it 's still a mistake to go see it .

What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .

A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .

De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .

Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .

A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -LRB- k -RRB- statement .

The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .

Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .

And forget about any attempt at a plot !

Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo 's cool jackets .

Showtime is closer to Slowtime .

It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .

The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .

` How many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '

Fans of the TV series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .

It 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .

An eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .

Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .

Bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .

Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did -- it 's called Where 's Chris Tucker When You Need Him ?

This film is full of rabbits .

Brimful .

But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .

If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .

Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .

Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery .

The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .

It 's painful .

Unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me .

A grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .

Watching the film is like reading a Times Portrait of Grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .

Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long 's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .

Just how extreme are these ops ?

Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .

Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .

A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .

None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .

Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .

Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .

A predictable , manipulative stinker .

The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .

It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating .

No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .

Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .

A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .

Got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2Â 1\/2 - hour , dissipated length .

Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .

One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .

Will anyone who is n't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ?

Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .

True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .

-LRB- Evans is -RRB- a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .

The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .

You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .

If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .

This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .

Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .

I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .

Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .

Who is this movie for ?

But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .

` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .

Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen

A serious movie with serious ideas .

The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .

Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .

I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .

The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .

It 's all surface psychodramatics .

Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .

I realized that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked , its story was making no sense at all .

Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .

Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .

Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .

Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .

The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .

The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .

Sweet Home Alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end .

No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story .

This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .

Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .

will be far more interesting to the Soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by Julia Roberts ...

The filmmaker ascends , literally , to the Olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster .

The film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .

A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .

Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .

a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .

A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .

entertaining enough , but nothing new

Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .

Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan .

... would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie 's edges .

Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .

The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card .

Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .

You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .

Directors Harry Gantz and Joe Gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves are n't all that interesting .

for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience

Femme Fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience .

Are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of Clue ?

Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .

Imagine Susan Sontag falling in love with Howard Stern .

Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .

Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , The Four Feathers comes up short .

A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy French grandfather .

The script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .

In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '

The obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .

It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .

Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .

Some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema .

This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .

Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an -LRB- emotionally at least -RRB- adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .

A sterling film - a cross between Boys Do n't Cry , Deliverance , and Ode to Billy Joe - lies somewhere in the story of Matthew Shepard , but that film is yet to be made .

After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .

Contrived pastiche of caper clichÃ©s .

Many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short .

Just a Kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people .

Like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless .

Despite its sincere acting , Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .

Yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other 's existence .

Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .

I ca n't remember the last time I saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there 's only one problem ... it 's supposed to be a drama .

Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .

Well , Jason 's gone to Manhattan and Hell , I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels -LRB- hey , do n't shoot the messenger -RRB- .

Bread , My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .

... while the humor aspects of ` Jason X ' were far more entertaining than I had expected , everything else about the film tanks .

The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .

... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .

... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''

Takes a clunky TV-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwright , poet and drinker .

Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .

Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .

Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .

A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .

It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .

Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .

It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .

A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .

Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .

Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist Japanese jokes .

Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .

It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .

On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .

The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .

... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .

Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .

Trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` What if ? '

scenario that will give most parents pause ... Then , something terrible happens .

Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .

A listless and desultory affair .

How inept is Serving Sara ?

Lazy , miserable and smug .

This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .

There 's no energy .

This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !

Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .

Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .

There are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .

Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .

There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .

A preposterous , prurient whodunit .

` Matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy .

At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .

A grating , emaciated flick .

We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .

According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .

But you 'd never guess that from the performances .

The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .

Ararat feels like a book report

Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .

A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .

An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension .

The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .

Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about

With miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp .

Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material

The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .

They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .

Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '

So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .

In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .

Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichÃ©s .

Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .

One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .

There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .

The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .

Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings .

What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .

A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the Bollywood films .

The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .

The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .

The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .

Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .

A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .

Serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .

Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .

A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .

-LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .

The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .

A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .

The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself .

Now he makes them .

Not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .

There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .

Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .

A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .

A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .

Bravado Kathy !

Too bad .

You can thank me for this .

I saw Juwanna Mann so you do n't have to .

Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .

It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .

If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .

I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .

There are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .

If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .

What might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .

Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .

Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .

Something must have been lost in the translation .

As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .

The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .

There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .

Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .

Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .

The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '

Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .

One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .

The story itself is actually quite vapid .

It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .

Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .

What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .

Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .

A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .

While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .

But it was n't .

For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .

It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .

The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .

A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .

Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .

The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .

When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?

This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '

A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .

Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .

Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .

A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .

-LRB- Siegel -RRB- and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie .

A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .

A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .

Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .

It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .

They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .

A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .

It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .

Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .

It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .

What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .

It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''

It 's that painful .

When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .

Or else a doggie winks .

-LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .

I did n't find much fascination in the swinging .

Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination .

It was a dark and stormy night ...

This sort of cute and cloying material is far from Zhang 's forte and it shows .

Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .

Freundlich 's made -LRB- Crudup -RRB- a suburban architect , and a cipher .

a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre

While American Adobo has its heart -LRB- and its palate -RRB- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .

Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .

Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in New York .

Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .

Hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .

A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .

It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .

The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .

Everything about Girls Ca n't Swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .

Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .

A road trip that will get you thinking , ` Are we there yet ? '

The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .

Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .

Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .

Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas .

Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .

The truth about Charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project .

displays the potential for a better movie than what Bailly manages to deliver

So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .

Rosenthal -LRB- Halloween II -RRB- seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .

Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .

Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .

This is n't a terrible film by any means , but it 's also far from being a realized work .

After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .

The sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .

Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .

This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .

The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .

Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .

Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .

Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .

This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .

It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .

The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a soufflÃ© gone wrong .

No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .

Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .

This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .

So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .

I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .

`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .

Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .

Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .

Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .

A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .

The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .

Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .

Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .

A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .

Its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .

Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .

Everything else about High Crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .

Just dreadful .

I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?

Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- better films .

hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .

Even kids deserve better .

And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .

Bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of Castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .

... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .

Frank Capra played this story straight .

How about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?

An uplifting drama ... What Antwone Fisher is n't , however , is original .

All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .

Well , it 's not as pathetic as The Animal .

Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .

Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .

The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .

A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .

He may have meant the Internet short Saving Ryan 's Privates .

But Windtalkers does n't beat that one , either .

Ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose Madonna .

Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .

... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . '

Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .

Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .

The characters never change .

What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?

Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .

Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .

Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .

All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .

Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .

An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .

The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .

The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .

Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .

A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special .

The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .

For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2Â 1\/2 - hour running time .

It looks good , but it is essentially empty .

The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .

The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .

It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .

Tennessee Williams by way of Oprah 's Book Club .

The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .

When ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .

The leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .

essentially `` Fatal Attraction '' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 .

The film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .

A culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is .

The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .

Hollywood 's answer to an air ball .

Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .

But it does n't leave you with much .

One of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way .

From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .

-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-America diversions could ever be .

This overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious .

A disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate IMAX trip .

This Sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama .

He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .

The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 \/ 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .

It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''

In a strange way , Egoyan has done too much .

A clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film ...

The movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichÃ©d and too often strains credulity .

What we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .

The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .

A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing .

To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .

There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .

The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .

Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?

It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .

` In this poor remake of such a well loved classic , Parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '

Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .

More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .

It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .

-- was a fad that had long since vanished .

more precious than perspicacious

If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .

Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .

Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs .

Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .

Nor is it a romantic comedy .

Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf .

The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .

Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .

It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .

Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .

Poor Ben Bratt could n't find stardom if MapQuest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .

Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .

A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .

Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget .

Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .

This is a children 's film in the truest sense .

The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .

Ice Age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .

Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .

Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '

Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .

It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .

... feels as if -LRB- there 's -RRB- a choke leash around your neck so director Nick Cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something .

Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .

He seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .

The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds .

At a brief 42 minutes , we need more X and less blab .

This 90-minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson 's E !

The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .

The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .

Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .

Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .

Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .

Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .

It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .

None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .

The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .

Same guy with both hats .

He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .

Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .

According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .

A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .

Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .

After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .

A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .

But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences

Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .

As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .

... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .

A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .

little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .

It 's Pauly Shore awful .

Do n't say you were n't warned .

The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .

` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .

The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .

It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .

An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .

Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .

Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .

It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .

Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .

When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .

The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .

The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .

The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .

It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .

A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .

Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .

You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .

As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed ' .

The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .

Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .

Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .

The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .

-LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .

Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '

The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .

Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .

It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .

Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .

Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .

When the heroes were actually under 40 ?

Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .

Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .

An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .

It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .

Disturbing .

Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .

Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .

A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .

Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .

A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .

Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .

The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .

What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .

Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .

Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .

The drama discloses almost nothing .

A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .

Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .

As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .

A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .

There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .

-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .

One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .

Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .

Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .

Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .

Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .

The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .

All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .

Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naÃ¯f 's encounter with the world .

I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .

If you go , pack your knitting needles .

The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .

Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .

Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .

Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .

Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .

The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .

You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .

I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits

Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .

The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .

An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .

A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .

One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .

What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .

An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .

Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda .

This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .

A full-frontal attack on audience patience .

It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .

The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .

The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .

The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .

Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .

Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on

It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .

Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .

More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .

An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .

The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .

As saccharine as it is disposable .

You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .

Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .

Muddled , trashy and incompetent

Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .

Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .

It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .

As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .

Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .

The script is smart , not cloying .

`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors

` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '

It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .

Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .

The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .

... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .

Compellingly watchable .

Troubling and powerful .

Often hilarious .

A modest masterpiece .

Never once predictable .

An uplifting , near-masterpiece .

Warm and exotic .

One-of-a-kind near-masterpiece .

A gripping drama .

An impressive hybrid .

An enjoyable experience .

A good thriller .

A glorious mess .

Intimate and panoramic .

Exciting documentary .

Good , solid storytelling .

Infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by Diane Lane .

Audacious-impossible yet compelling ...

Mr. Deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy .

Exciting and well-paced .

Really quite funny .

We 've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there 's an enthusiastic charm in Fire that makes the formula fresh again .

Her fans walked out muttering words like `` horrible '' and `` terrible , '' but had so much fun dissing the film that they did n't mind the ticket cost .
